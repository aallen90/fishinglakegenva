      </font></b></font></p>
      <hr>
      <p><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">I have had the pleasure of fishing
      with John four times this August, 2003, (twice with my 11 year old son, and twice
      with both my wife and son.) Each trip was a fabulous experience. John
      showed himself to be a knowledgeable, professional, and extremely capable
      guide. He was also honest and straightforward, willing to teach us what we
      needed to know, and most importantly, consistently able to put us on a
      'hot bite'. During our trips we caught crappie (lots of them!) smallmouth
      bass, largemouth bass, northern and walleye. (My wife earned the nick-name
      'crappie queen', as she seemed to be landing more than her fair share of
      the really big ones!)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">There is a great story that goes
      with one of the 'smallies.' With one hour left during one of our trips, I
      told John that my personal best smallmouth bass was 16 inches. He said he
      thought he could do better than that for me in the time we had left. We
      re-rigged, as we were fishing for crappie at the time. Within 20 minutes I
      had a strong fish on the line. It was a smallie, and when we got it into
      the boat it measured out to 18 and 3/4 inches. Was luck involved?
      Certainly. But in my experience, luck like that only happens when a strong
      dose of knowledge and skill are worked into the mix.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">My wife, son and I can't wait until
      our next opportunity to book John for a trip.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&quot;Every time I have been on the
      water with John it has been enjoyable and informative.&nbsp; His knowledge
      about where the fish are and where to catch them always impresses me and
      has made me a more successful angler.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Walleyes, crappies, bass and
      bluegills, it doesn't matter... John has always put me on the fish.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&quot;We have fished Lake Geneva a
      couple times prior on our own with very little success and were becoming
      quite discouraged. This was until we hired John to guide us. Our first day
      out, John put us on the fish that we could never find ourselves. Barbara
      and I only had three days to fish, and needless to say after the first
      day, we hired John for the remainder of our stay and had the time of our lives!
      I am now a firm believer of night fishing too. Barbara caught her personal
      best Walleye (5 lbs. 15 oz) and Smallmouth (3.5 lbs) .... who could ask
      for more?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">We are planning several trips back
      to Lake Geneva over the next few months, and without question, John will
      be our guide. Thanks again for making our trip so special!!&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&quot;Listen up folks!&nbsp; We had
      the fishing time of our life this past summer with John Trossen.&nbsp;
      Folks if you are looking for a guide on Lake Geneva, look no further, you
      have just connected with the 'Mother Load'.&nbsp; John is at the
      top of his game and will provide the results you are looking
      for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">From the first fish we caught to the
      last it was non-stop heart pounding, hook setting excitement!&nbsp; John
      is Outstanding!&nbsp; The whole time I laughed, learned a ton, and caught
      plenty of fish.&nbsp; If you fish Lake Geneva, do yourself a favor, do it
      with the best guide, and a great person, John Trossen, you will not be
      disappointed.&quot;</font></p>
